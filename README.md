## What It Is

TimeJournal is a visual time-tracking journal built as a single HTML file. It mirrors Google Calendar's 7-day weekly layout but focuses on recording what you've already done rather than planning ahead. The goal is self-awareness — seeing exactly where your hours go across sleep, study, work, leisure, and everything in between.

## Core Capabilities

- **Weekly calendar grid** with 24-hour rows and 7-day columns, scrollable and swipeable
- **Live tracking** — start a timer on any activity, stop when finished
- **Manual entry** — click any time slot or use the + button to log past events with full date/time control
- **Cross-midnight events** — sleep and overnight activities render correctly across two days
- **23 built-in activities** across 8 color-coded categories (Productive, School, Health, Creative, Social, Leisure, Time Waste, Necessary)
- **Custom activities** — add your own with emoji icons and category assignments
- **Analytics dashboard** — pie charts, bar charts, 90-day heatmap, streak tracking, daily productivity scores
- **Daily goals** with progress bars and target tracking
- **Pomodoro timer** linked to activities for focused work sessions
- **Mood tracking** and weekly reflection journaling
- **Recurring events** and reusable day templates
- **Untracked gap detection** highlighting periods you forgot to log
- **Undo/Redo** for all actions
- **JSON export/import** for backups and device transfers
- **Dark/Light mode** toggle

## How To Use

Download `timejournal.html` and open it in any browser. No installation, no internet, no accounts. Tap the calendar to add events, use the bottom navigation to switch between Calendar, Analytics, Activities, and Settings. All data persists automatically between sessions via browser storage.

## Limitations

Data lives in your browser's localStorage. Clearing browser data erases everything — use the export feature regularly for backups.
